<h1>Stephan's Journal</h1>
<h2> October 3, 2022</h2>
<p>This is my first journal entry after finishing my person card. I liked adding a back button to every page that takes you back to the homepage. This will allow you to surf the whole website with ease.</p>
<h2>October 6, 2022</h2>
<p>This is my second journal entry. I just finished my first edition/draft of my website. So far the process has been fairly managable. I enjoyed finding which colors to use on the homepage.</p>
