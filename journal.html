<h1>Stephan's Journal</h1>
<h2> October 3, 2022</h2>
<p>This is my first journal entry after finishing my person card. I liked adding a back button to every page that takes you back to the homepage. This will allow you to surf the whole website with ease.</p>
<h2>October 6, 2022</h2>
<p>This is my second journal entry. I just finished my first edition/draft of my website. So far the process has been fairly managable. I enjoyed finding which colors to use on the homepage.</p>
<h2> October 17, 2022</h2>
<p>Today in class we learned how to open and alter our consol. We also learned how to use strings and variables. We watched Rocko's modern life and Catdog. We also used strings in our codes and figured out how they affect the use of our code going forward.</p>
<h2> October 31, 2022</h2>
<p> We have learned so many things in a such small amount of time. We have learned about variables, which are the named functions store information and when called complete an action, we have learned about strings, which are simply just text that can be connected to components of the code such as the variables. In addition, we have learned about numbers and how to do basic math as well as avoiding syntax errors and using strings for numbers. A function is a variable that is called into action and completes the command that the user inputs.</p>
<h2> November 4, 2022</h2>
<p>Today I completed my codesketch project. I created a soccer ball spawner that creates a ball every time you click. I completed this by first creating divs for both the background and the image, then styling them to look in proportion. Then I used Java to track where the mouse of the user is when they click. I then told the code that whenever the user clicks it spawns a soccer ball on the click and my project is working very well.</p>
<h2> November 7, 2022</h2>
<p>Today in class we focused primarily on event listeners. Event listeners are a way to make it so when you click around the page, it records an event. In this case it records when the user clicks. In order to see that you are doing it correct, you can go to a page and double click. Then click inspect and go to the console tab. When you start to click around the page the event listner records the x and y coordinates of your click. We then created a div so that when you click it prints an image on your click.</p>
